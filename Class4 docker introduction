Goal: reduce the time, cost and improve the quality

There are two methods of deployment-

1) Host deployment:
===================
We just run the steps provides by developer.

As part of Host deployment we need to do-
1) server provisioning[Installing software in top of server]
2) executing build commands

As it is a manual work, their might be chances that we are doing manual error.

Deployment time= Provisioning time + build time + other component start time = 5 minutes

Host deployment steps
=====================
apt-get update
apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless -y
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
java -jar target/*.jar


Now, as Devops Engineer our job is to reduce this 5 minute to 1 minute

Container deployment
====================
In deployment Ops is not supposed to install any software they just need to run the one command

docker run -p 8080:8080 2020ht66049/image1:SPC

Goal: Converting host deployment to container deployment


Forward compatibility and backward compactbility
=================================================
Test spring pet clinic with java16


Docker hub
==========
It's a place where Everyone would be storing our images.
https://hub.docker.com/

Docker playground
=================
It's a place https://labs.play-with-docker.com/

Docker
======
A tool that Package application with their depandanices.
