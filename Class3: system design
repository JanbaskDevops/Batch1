Today's Agenda
===============
Agile Methodology[How we are saving the cost]
   TDD
Physical server and data center
Hypervisor[Type1 and type2]
Virtual server
simulator
forward compatibility and backward compatibility
Monolithic application
Microservices application

Casestudy: I want to make calculator[Addition, substraction, multiplication and divison]


1) Development[codding]
2) Testing[Internal]
3) Client testing team
4) Deployment team

Let say each row represent 1 day

In this scenario, I am going to take 16 days to deliver my project, and 75% of people are having no work.

if we are breaking our task into multiple task then my efficienty is going to increase.

Role of Agile: The ability to move about quickly and easily.

In agile we have different approache?

1) TDD[Test driven development]
===============================

2+2=4
10000+50000=60000
900*90=81000

initial stage I will not write any code, I will just write the testcase, and when I am running the TC, code would be failed, now I will confine the code
as per TC


Unit testing
=============
Add(2,4)==6 # Unit testing, these test cases are written by developer

General: Code > Test > deploy
TDD:     Test(fail) > Code > Test > deploy


Working on TDD agile methodology for delivering the software.

git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw test

Practical implemtation of Agile
================================
When we would be implemting Agile we have 4 ways-
1) Basic
2) Agile
3) CMMI
4) Scrum

Physical server
===============
A machine with: 256 MB of RAM, although more than 2 GB is recommended. 10 GB of drive space (for Jenkins and your Docker image)

> Oraganisation are purchasing higher capacity server

> How to create virtual server from physical server.

>>Hypervisor<<
==============
Tool that allow to create virtual server from physical server

1) Type1:

2) Type2:

How to know which hypervisor I am using $lscpu


Agile to microservice movement
=================================
1) When we are breaking application to multiple parts, we can change the technology also.

2) Issue with point 1
======================
1) My Devops lifecyle would be change from 1 to 4 which might need additional resource to manage the load.

2) My server would be heavy[More software installed]


3) To address point 2 Hypervisor came into picture.

Hypervisor: 1960
Advance hypervisor

4) If I assign 1 GB RAM and 10 GB HDD, so my server can't use more than that, if it is using less then I am wasting my resource. to solve this problem we have container.

5) Container are server which perfectly use your memory, RAM and HDD
