A blanket approval refers to a general authorization given by a person or authority that applies to a wide range of items, actions, or decisions without requiring individual assessment or approval for each one. This type of approval can streamline processes by reducing the need for multiple approvals, but it also requires a high level of trust and clear guidelines to ensure proper oversight and accountability.
