1) Process must be uniform

2) Enforce deployment process used by all, including Dev and Ops
personnel. In general, when a process becomes enforced, some individuals
may be required to change their normal operating procedures and,
possibly, the structure of the systems on which they work. One point where
a deployment process could be enforced is in the initiation phase of each
system. Each system, when it is initialized, verifies its pedigree. That is, it
arrived at execution through a series of steps, each of which can be
checked to have occurred. Furthermore, the systems on which it depends
(e.g., operating systems or middleware) also have verifiable pedigrees.
